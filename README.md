# ATM Design and Implementation

This is a two-part project, the first of which is a *team* effort,
while the second is an *individual* effort. Because the second part
of the project will make use of the results of the first part, only
submissions that reach a certain threshold of functionality by the
nominal deadline will be targets for the second part.  The second
part is due at the end of the semester, so extensions cannot be
granted.

In this project you will first design and implement a prototype
ATM/Bank system. Then you will get a chance to (try to) attack other
teams' designs! We have tried to make these instructions as explicit
as possible. Read them carefully; *if anything is unclear, please ask
for clarification well in advance.*


Part 1, the team phase of the project, is described in
[build-it.md](build-it.md).

Part 2, the solo phase of the project, is described in
[break-it.md](break-it.md).
